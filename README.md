# RailIndia

The aim of this project is to build a web application that allows users to 
view the information of various trains and stations in the Indian Railway 
network. It also allows users to book seats on a train and view the 
availability. 

The web application also displays various statistics relating to the 
Indian Railway network dataset. The detailed project proposal can be 
viewed at this
